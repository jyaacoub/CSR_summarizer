Google is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions across all operations and value chain by 2030. The company plans to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions. Google is carbon-neutral, with all of its products' operational GHG emissions being compensated for through procurement of renewable energy and carbon credits. The company has also diverted 78% of waste from its global data center operations away from landfills, and refurbished 27% of components used for server upgrades.
