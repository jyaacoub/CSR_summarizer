GOOGLE_CSR_RAND_TEXTS =["""Accelerating carbon-free and circular
To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, 
we launched our third decade of climate action , and we’re now working 
toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:
Achieve	 net-zero	emissions 	across	all	of	our	operations	and	value	chain, 	 
including	our	consumer	hardware	products
Become	the	 first	major	company	to	run	on	 carbon-free	energy 	24	hours	a	day, 	
seven	days	a	week,	365	days	a	year
Enable	5	gigawatts	of	new	carbon-free	energy	through	investments	in	our	key 	
manufacturing	regions
Help	more	than	500	cities	and	local	governments	reduce	an	aggregate	of 	 
1	gigaton	of	carbon	emissions	annually
We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources  across our operations, 
products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.
As part of our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations 
and value chain by 2030, we aim to reduce the majority of our  emissions 
(versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based 
and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining 
emissions.  We know this will be a challenging journey and we expect our 
progress toward this goal to be nonlinear. While our total GHG emissions 
increased from 2020 to 2021, we’re committed to achieving GHG reductions 
throughout our operations and value chain.""", 

"""Empowering everyone with technology
To empower everyone with technology, we’ve committed to help 1 billion 
people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core 
products. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, new features  
to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints, 
and Nest Renew, a program to support clean energy from home. And when 
people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we 
show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.
Benefiting people and places
To benefit the people and places where we operate, we’ve set goals to 
replenish more water than we consume  by 2030 and to support water security 
in communities where we operate. We’re focused on three areas: enhancing 
our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; 
replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems 
in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help 
everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.
At Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability , and we’ll 
continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our 
planet. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re energized to help 
move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.""",


"""Environmental data
The following table provides an overview of our performance over time and 
includes both environmental data for our global operations (including our data  
centers, offices, networking infrastructure, and other facilities) and data beyond  
our operations (including our investments and technology). The majority of our  
environmental data covers Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries, including 
Google LLC. All reported data is global and annual unless otherwise specified. 
We obtain third-party assurance from an independent, accredited auditor for 
specific environmental data as part of our Independent Accountants’ Review , 
including select GHG emissions, energy, and water metrics as indicated in the 
table below.
