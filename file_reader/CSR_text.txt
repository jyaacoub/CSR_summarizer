Our approach
We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect 
our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive  
to build sustainability into everything we do.
We’ve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google’s 
founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over 
the past two decades:
2007:	We	became	the	 first	major	company	to	be	carbon	neutral	 for	our	operations.
2017:	We	became	the	 first	major	company	to	match	100%	of	our	annual	electricity 	
use	with	renewable	energy,			 which	we’ve	achieved	 for	five	consecutive	years.
2020:	We	issued	$5.75	billion	in	 sustainability	bonds —the	largest	sustainability 	 
or	green	bond	issuance	by	any	company	in	history	at	the	time.
2021:	We	matched	66%	of	our	data	center	electricity	use	with	regional 	 
carbon-free	sources,	on	an	hourly	basis.
Our sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating 
the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering 
everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we 
operate (see Figure 1).

Accelerating carbon-free and circular
To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, 
we launched our third decade of climate action , and we’re now working 
toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:
Achieve	 net-zero	emissions 	across	all	of	our	operations	and	value	chain, 	 
including	our	consumer	hardware	products
Become	the	 first	major	company	to	run	on	 carbon-free	energy 	24	hours	a	day, 	
seven	days	a	week,	365	days	a	year
Enable	5	gigawatts	of	new	carbon-free	energy	through	investments	in	our	key 	
manufacturing	regions
Help	more	than	500	cities	and	local	governments	reduce	an	aggregate	of 	 
1	gigaton	of	carbon	emissions	annually
We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources  across our operations, 
products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.
As part of our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations 
and value chain by 2030, we aim to reduce the majority of our  emissions 
(versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based 
and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining 
emissions.  We know this will be a challenging journey and we expect our 
progress toward this goal to be nonlinear. While our total GHG emissions 
increased from 2020 to 2021, we’re committed to achieving GHG reductions 
throughout our operations and value chain.

Empowering everyone with technology
To empower everyone with technology, we’ve committed to help 1 billion 
people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core 
products. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, new features  
to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints, 
and Nest Renew, a program to support clean energy from home. And when 
people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we 
show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.
Benefiting people and places
To benefit the people and places where we operate, we’ve set goals to 
replenish more water than we consume  by 2030 and to support water security 
in communities where we operate. We’re focused on three areas: enhancing 
our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; 
replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems 
in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help 
everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.
At Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability , and we’ll 
continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our 
planet. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re energized to help 
move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.

Appendix 
Endnotes
1. According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.
2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to 
power IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means 
nearly all the energy is used for computing.
3. According to the Uptime Institute’s 2021 Data Center Survey , the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.57.
4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit 
is created. References to “carbon offsets” (as mentioned in prior reports) were updated to “carbon credits” starting in Google’s 2021 Environmental Report. For more information on our 
approach to purchasing carbon credits, see our 2011 white paper, Google’s Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence .
5. This estimated spend commitment is for clean energy purchased for our operations. It may fluctuate over time based on the number of contracts signed and energy market prices.
6. Based on our cumulative renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hours (MWh) from 2012 to 2021.
7. The first year Google signed a renewable energy contract  was 2010.
8. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, 
distributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google’s operations, these efforts go beyond Google’s long-standing 
commitment to operational carbon neutrality.
9. Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat: Energy Bill Analysis Results , Nest Labs, February 2015.
10. Independent studies showed that Nest saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling. Using typical energy costs, we’ve estimated average savings of  
$131 to $145 a year. That means the Nest Learning Thermostat can pay for itself in under two years. Individual savings are not guaranteed.
11. Nest and Pixel devices are designed with 9%–68% recycled content across their respective plastic parts in 2020 and 2021. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, 
labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, 
coatings, and adhesives. The aluminum in the enclosure of Pixel 5 is 100% recycled content. (Back housing only. Recycled aluminum is approximately 58% of the Pixel 5 enclosure 
based on weight.) The aluminum in the housing of Pixel 6 is 100% recycled content. (Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 
14% of product based on weight.)
12. Carbon footprint reduction claim based on third-party verified life cycle assessment. Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 
14% of product based on weight.
13. One petabyte is 1015 bytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of digital information. It’s equal to approximately 2.5 months of uninterrupted, uncompressed, high-definition (1920 x 1080 pixels) 
video data.
14. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match.
15. For more details, see our 2021 white paper, Carbon-free Energy Performance at Google Data Centers .
16. We reach operational carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives. Second, we match 
100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy high-quality carbon credits for any remaining operational emissions we 
haven’t yet eliminated.
17. In this report, “Bay Area headquarters” refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale.
18. Fitbit wearable devices were not included in the scope of these targets in 2021.
19. Flagship consumer hardware products are products that can provide their main functionality without connection to another product. For example, this does not include accessories, 
such as earbuds or cases.
20. Minimum percentage of recycled or renewable plastic content calculated as a percentage of total plastic (by weight) in all products manufactured in 2025. The following may be 
excluded from the calculation of percentage: printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge 
components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives. Renewable content consists of plastic made from bio-based material.
21. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, 
electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives.
22. See note 11 above.
23. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed select quantitative performance indicators for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. See the related Independent Accountants’ Review Report . Prior to 
fiscal year 2019, another third party verified the following emissions: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting), 
and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports .
24. Alphabet’s fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31.
25. GHG emissions are calculated according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards  and guidance , developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) , Scope 2 Guidance , and the  Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) 
Accounting and Reporting Standard . For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories, see Alphabet’s CDP Climate Change Responses on 
Google’s sustainability reports  page. 
26. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google’s offices and data centers. 
Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based 
category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and thus where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category 
incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in  
our value chain, such as business travel or our suppliers.
27. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of 
a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon 
dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.
28. Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity 
procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released updated  
Scope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data.
29. Google currently buys enough renewable energy to match our annual global electricity consumption. To achieve our 100% renewable energy match goal, we first consider both 
our on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that is already in the electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure renewable energy through PPA 
contracts. We have a few facilities located in geographies where we’re not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying 
surplus renewable energy in regions where it’s abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy 
purchases in Asia. This approach results in Google’s Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance , despite us 
achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally. To work toward eliminating GHG emissions associated with our electricity use (Scope 2 market-based emissions), we set the 
ambitious goal of achieving 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 . To attain this, we’re evolving from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing  
carbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere.
30. See note 25 above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware 
manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s hardware includes 
data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.
32. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation 
methodology outlined in EcoAct’s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper  to our annual average workforce to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working remotely 
from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for Calculating 
Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0) . For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2021 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .
33. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions  
reported prior to 2020 do not include teleworking emissions.
34. See note 31 above.
35. We calculate two metrics for operational emissions, one using market-based Scope 2 and one using location-based Scope 2. The Scope 2 market-based and location-based amounts 
have been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP, as shown in the Schedule of Select Environmental Indicators attached to the 2021 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .  
In the 2021 Independent Accountants’ Review Report, the Schedule of Operational GHG emissions After Compensation Adjustments only includes the market-based metric.
36. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper,  
10 Years of Carbon Neutrality . In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon  
neutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).
37. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method GHG 
emissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors.
38. See note 36 above.
39. Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions. For more information on year-over-year changes to market-based  
Scope 2 emissions, see note 29 above.
40. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources.
41. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations  
(i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the 
total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. 
Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.
42. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance  requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s  
electricity-consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity’s operations are located.
43. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated 
using both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid mix is based on data obtained from a third-party, 
electricityMap, and has not been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics .
44. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.
45. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic.
46. In 2021, we continued to experience limited café operations due to the global pandemic. As a result, we were unable to update our cumulative total for pre-consumer food waste 
prevented in our cafés.
47. In 2021, there was less inventory to be resold due to market shortages and the continued impact of the global pandemic.
48. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. Data for total water consumption 
and total water discharge is not available for prior years.
49. Our reported water withdrawal, water consumption, and water discharge metrics do not include seawater.
50. 2018 is the first year that reflects a refinement in Green Business Certification Inc.’s methodology for determining LEED-certified office space.
51. This figure indicates the number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada, which represent the majority of our EV charging ports in those countries.
52. Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only. While Google’s total number of installed EV charging 
ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the global pandemic, resulting in a decrease in emissions 
avoided due to employee EV commuting that year. In 2021, EV charging ports continued to experience limited use due to office closures and related decreases in employee EV commuting.
53. Due to the global pandemic, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area were in operation only from January to March in 2020 and from July to December in 2021.
54. See note 53 above.
55. See note 53 above.
56. All ecology projects that were scheduled for completion in 2020 were delayed due to the global pandemic.
57. See note 56 above. 
58. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that are not used to directly mitigate our emissions. This indicator 
represents the expected combined capacity of contracted renewable energy projects in which we have an equity investment, even if we’re a minority owner.
59. Project Sunroof metrics have been incorporated into updates for the Environmental Insights Explorer. See the tool  for more information about rooftop solar potential data.
60. We updated the unit of this key performance indicator from “cities” in prior reports to “cities and regions.” This change more accurately describes the data boundaries for the 
Environmental Insights Explorer and does not represent a change in underlying methodology or related calculations.
